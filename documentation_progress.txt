During the programming I found and fixed these annoying bugs:
{Great Ammo Bug: bullets flying to same side where player moving,
Portal Randomize Bug: portal teleport player and player could get out the borders of playing field.



Alpha:

Alpha 0.1.0 - realised moving of the player, shooting with Great Ammo Bug and sprites of portal.
Alpha 0.2.0 - Great Ammo Bug was fixed, borders appeared. Else main problem became Portal Randomize Bug.
